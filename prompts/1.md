Analyze this workspace and create or update `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. The file guides future AI coding agents here.

Add:
- Core commands, especially build, lint, test (incl. single-test run), docs, migrations, etc.
- High-level architecture, including major packages, services, data stores, external APIs, etc.
- Repo-specific style rules, including formatting, imports, typing, naming, error handling, etc.
- Relevant agent rules detected in `.cursor/**`, `.cursorrules`, `AGENTS.md`, `AGENT.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.windsurfrules`, existing Copilot file, etc.
- Summarize important parts of README or other docs instead of copying them.

Guidelines (read more at https://aka.ms/vscode-instructions-docs):
- If `.github/copilot-instructions.md` exists, patch/merge. Never overwrite blindly.
- Be concise; skip boilerplate, generic advice, or exhaustive file listings.
- Use Markdown headings + bullets; keep prose minimal and non-repetitive.
- Cite only facts found in the repo (don't invent information).

> Copilot: I'll analyze this workspace and create or update the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file to guide future AI coding agents working on this MixerGame project.

> ```markdown
> [ ] Analyze the current workspace structure and identify key files
> [ ] Check if `.github/copilot-instructions.md` already exists
> [ ] Examine package.json for build commands and dependencies
> [ ] Review README.md for project overview
> [ ] Look for existing agent rules in various locations
> [ ] Analyze the codebase architecture and key components
> [ ] Create or update the copilot instructions file

> Let me start by examining the workspace structure to understand this project. Now I'll check if `.github/copilot-instructions.md` already exists. Let me check if there's a `.github` directory at all. I need to read the package.json to understand the build commands and dependencies. Now let me read the README.md to understand the project overview. Let me check the spec.md file for more project details. Now let me examine the source code structure to understand the architecture. Let me read the main TypeScript files to understand the code structure. Let me also check the tsconfig.json and webpack.config.js for build configuration. Now let me check for any existing agent configuration files. Let me check the songs directory structure to understand the data organization. Now I have enough information to create the copilot instructions. Let me update my todo list:

> I've successfully created the copilot-instructions.md file for the MixerGame project. The file includes:
> 
> **Core Commands**: Build, development server, and local testing commands from package.json
> **Architecture Overview**: TypeScript + WebAudio API + Custom Web Components structure
> **Code Style Rules**: TypeScript standards, naming conventions, and audio programming patterns
> **Development Guidelines**: Audio file requirements, performance considerations, and browser compatibility
> **Language Context**: Notes about Traditional Chinese usage in the project
> 
> The instructions are tailored specifically to this audio mixing game project, focusing on the WebAudio API usage patterns, the custom VolumeSlider component, and the unique audio processing pipeline that's central to the game's functionality.
